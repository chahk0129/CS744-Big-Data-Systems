# Part 3

## How to run
> Inside each task, we have a detailed README.md that explains how to run the application.


## Directories
> task1 includes a PageRank algorithm that runs with default configurations. That is, driver and executor memory size of 30GB, 5 executor cores, and one CPU per task.
> task2 includes a PageRank algorithm that runs with different number of partitions and different executor memory sizes.
> task3 includes a PageRank algorithm that is similar to $task2$ except for caching intermediate data in memory.
> task4 includes a PageRank algorithm that is similar to $task3$, but it is designed to evaluate the effects when we kill a worker process.
