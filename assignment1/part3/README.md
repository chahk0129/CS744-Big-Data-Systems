# Part 3

## How to run
> Inside each task, we have a detailed README.md that explains how to run the application.


## Directories
> task1 includes a PageRank algorithm that runs with default configurations. That is, driver and executor memory size of 30GB, 5 executor cores, and one CPU per task.<br/>
> task2 includes a PageRank algorithm that runs with different number of partitions and different executor memory sizes.<br/>
> task3 includes a PageRank algorithm that is similar to task2 except for caching intermediate data in memory.<br/>
> task4 includes a PageRank algorithm that is similar to task3, but it is designed to evaluate the effects when we kill a worker process.<br/>
